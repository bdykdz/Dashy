2. **Access to a Comprehensive Project Overview**
   - **As a** project manager,
   - **I want to** have a dashboard that provides a detailed overview of each project, including scheduled hours, project progress, and any impending deadlines,
   - **So that** I can quickly assess the status of each project, identify any potential issues, and make informed decisions to keep the project on track.

3. **Insight into Overall Company Operations**
   - **As a** project manager,
   - **I want to** view a dashboard that gives an overview of the company's operations as a whole, including all ongoing projects, resource allocations, and company-wide deadlines,
